# REVIEWS LOGIC

JUST SO YOU KNOW, USERS SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWES TO LEAVE REVIEW TO A PRODUCT HE BOUGHT ,AND ONLY ONE REVIEW SHOULD BE ALLOWED OFCOURSE

BUT WE DON'T WANT TO OVER COMPLICATE OUR EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIOS, SO WE WILL ALLOW OUR USER TO LEAVE A REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT THAT IS MARKED AS DELIVERED (IF THE ADMIN MARKED PRODUCT AS DELIVERED WE WILL ALLOW REVIEWS)

REVIEWS (RATING PORTION (WHICH WE CALCULATE) IS IMPORTANT FOR MAIN PAGE), AND WE NEE TO ADD UI FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT PAGE WHERE WE ARE GOING TO DISPLAY REVIEW COMMENT AND RATING AND MAYBE SOME OTHER STUFF

## FIRST LET'S MAKE SEEDING ROUTE FOR REVIEWS

WE CAN USE [MOCKAROO]() TO GENERATE SOME JSON WE CAN SEED

`pages/api/mock/seed-reviews.ts`

## LETS NOW EXTEND PRODUCT PAGE, WHERE, FOR THE START, WE GOING TO QUERY FOR REVIEWS INSIDE `getServerSideProps` AND PASS THEM AS ADDITIONAL TO OTHER STUFF

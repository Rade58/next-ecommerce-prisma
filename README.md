# MAKING CORRECTIONS TO OUR SCHEMA

IN LAST BRNCH I FORGOT TO THINK OF SOME MODELS I CAN ADD

ALSO WE NEED TO ALTER TYPES ON SOME FIELDS

WE NEED COUPLE OF MODELS:

WE NEED `Order` MODEL (**ONE ORDER CAN BE AN ORDER FOR MANY PRODUCTS (JUST THINK OF THAT)**)

**ALSO ORDER NEEDS TO HAVE: PENDING,  FULFILLED OR REJECTED `status`** (SO I'M ADDING NEW ENUM FOR THAT PURPOSE)

WE NEED `Review` MODEL

WE NEED `reviews` FIELD ON `Product`

# I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO USE `Transaction` MODEL (TABLE) AT ALL

I ALSO HAVE A MISTKE IN IT SINCE IT IS USED AS A TRNSACTION FOR ONLY ONE PRODUCT

AND THAT WONT BE THE CASE IN MY APP

**WE WON'T NEED Transaction MODEL BECAUSE WITH Order MODEL WE WILL HAVE INFO WHAT IS BOUGHT AND WHAT NOT, SINCE ON ORDER WE WILL HAVE STATUS (PENDING, REJECTED , FULFILLED) AND AMOUNT OF MMONEY**

# SINCE THERE IS NO OPTION (IN CASE OF SQL) THAT WE CA HVE ARRAY OF FORGEIN KEYS, WE WILL HOLLD IDs INSIDE THE ARRY

ONE EXAMPLE IS ARRAY OF PRODUCTS ON ORDER RECORD

**WE WILL USE PRODUCT ID'S FOR THAT PURPOSE**

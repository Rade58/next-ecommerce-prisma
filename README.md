# BUILDING BETTER PAGINATION FOR PRODUCTS

FIRST LET'S CHANGE OUR INDEX PAGE IN TERMS WHAT ARE WE QUERYING

INDEX PAGE SHOULD HAVE ONLY 10 MOST POPULAR PRODUCTS

AND IT SHOULD HAVE LINK FOR `SEE MORE PRODUCTS`

THAT SHOULD TAKE USER TO TO THE `/products/p/[pageNumber]` PAGE

```
mkdir pages/products/p && touch "pages/products/p/[page].tsx"
```

AND FOR THIS PAGE WE WILL DEFINE LINKS FOR PAGINATION

AS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO PAY TTENTION TO CURSOR

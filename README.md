# SEARCH FOR PRODUCTS

WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS BY USING [THIS FROM MATERIAL UI](https://material-ui.com/components/autocomplete/#autocomplete)

BUT LETS CUSTOMIZE IT A LITTLE BIT

I DECIDED TO TRY OUT [react-select](https://react-select.com/home#getting-started)

## I DEVELOPED THIS FOR FRONTEND

```
cat components/Search.tsx
```

## AND THIS IS API ROUTE FOR GETTING PRODUCT NAMES, AND FOR GETTING SLUGS

```
cat 
```

WE ARE HITTING THIS ROUTE ONLY WHEN HEADER MOUNTS

I THINK RESOULT FROM THIS ROUTE NEEDS TO BE IN LOCAL STORAG OR SOMETHING (I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THT NOW)

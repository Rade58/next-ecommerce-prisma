# CHECKOUT PROCESS, SETTING UP STUFF, SKAFFOLDING PAGES, MAKING REDIRECTS

WE WILL HAVE SHIPPING PAGE

```
touch pages/shipping.tsx
```

**IF YOU ARE NOT SIGNIN AND YOU GO TO SHIPPING PAGE, YOU SHOULD BE REDIRETED TO SIGNIN PAGE**

WE ARE GOING TO SET THAT UP FIRST

**I HAD PROBLEMS MAKING REDIRECT SERVER SIDE, SO I DID IT FRONT END**

**BUT ALSO WHEN YOU LOG IN YOU SHOUD BE REDDIRECCTED T O SHIPPING**

SO WE NEED TO DEFINE THAT LOGIC

**WE CAN CHECK HISTORY AND DO SOME REDIRECTS BASED ON HISTORY**

**I THINK WE NEED TO USE ANOTHER MACHINE, THAT WILL HANDLE THAT REDIRECTING, OR BETTER TO SAY PROGRAMMATICAL NAVIGATION**

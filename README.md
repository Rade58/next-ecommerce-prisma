# SEEDING PRODUCTS

I TOLD YOU THAT I'M STARTTING WITH USERS FIRST

BUT I THINK IT IS EASIER FOR ME TO SEED PRODUCTS (AND AFTER THAT I'M GOING TO BUILD PRODUCTS TABLE WITH PAGINATION)

## HELPFUL LINK FOR SEEDING

<https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database>

**BUT I HAD PROBLEMS TO MAKE THIS WORK**

**SO I DECIDED TO MAKE ROUTE FOR SEEDING PRODUCTS**

I'M GOING TO USE THAT ROUTE ONLY ONE OFCOURSES

# FIRST I MADE MOCK PRODUCTS BY USING ONLINE TOOL

FIRST I USED <https://www.mockaroo.com/> TO MAKE BUNCH OF PRODUCTS

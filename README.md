# DATBASE SETUP

GOING TO USE PostgreSQL INSTANCE FROM [SUPABASE](https://supabase.io/)

AND WE ARE GOING TO USE PRISMA ORM

# WHAT DO I NEED IN PRISMA SCHEMA

FIRST OF ALL [YOU NEED TO KNOW MORE AND UNDERSTAND DATA MODEL IN PRISMA](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model)

AND FOR OUR PROJECT ESPECCIALLY WE NEED THESE MODELS:

- `User` MODEL (KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU NEED ALL THE COLUMNS REQUIRED BY THE [NEXT-AUTH](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma#setup), SINCE WE WILL IMPLEMENT AUTHENTICATION WITH NEXT AUTH LATTER ON) (ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR USER NEEDS A ROLE: "ADMIN" OR "USER" (BECAUSE LATTER ON WE WILL DEFINE THAT ONLY ADMIN CAN ADD PRODUCTS))

- `Product` MODEL (SHOULD HAVE REFERENCE TO ADMIN WHO CREATED THE PRODUCT)

- `Transaction` MODEL (SHOULD HAVE REFERENCE OF THE Product AND REFERENCE FOR THE User WHO BOUGHT THE PRODUCT) (THIS SHOUD BE CREATED ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT WHCH WE WILL PROCESS WITH PAYPAL LATTER ON)

# PROJECT LISTING ON HOME SCREEN WITH HELP FROM DUMMY DATA AND DUMMY IMAGES

DUMY PRODUCTS ARE INSIDE `dummy/products.ts`

AND IMAGES ARE INSIDE `public/images`

I WILL 'FETCH DUMMY DATA' (ALL PRODUCTS) INSIDE getStaticProps

IN FUTURE WHEN YOU INTRODUCE REAL DATA, YOU JUST REPLACE DUMMY DATA WITH FETCHES FOR REEAL DATA

## WHAT AM I GOING TO DO

I'M GOING TO BUILD COMPONENT FOR DISPLAYING MOCK PRODUCTS ON INDEX PAGE

**IDEA IS TO LATTER ON, DISPLAY ACTUL DATA WITH THE SAME COMPONENT**

`components/1_index_page/Products.tsx`

## I WILL ALSO SKAFFOLD DYNAMIC PAGE FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT

YES, I DID USE getStaticPaths AND getStaticProps

YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR YOURSELF

## I DECIDED TOO ALSO BUILD UI FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT PAGE, I JUST MENTIONED

`pages/products/[prodId].tsx`

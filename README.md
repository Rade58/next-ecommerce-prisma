digression:

IN FUTURE FOR FUTURE PROJECTS YOU CAN LOOK INTO USING [REACT-BOOTSTRAP](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) TOGETHER WITH [BOOTSWATCH](https://bootswatch.com/) (WHEN INSTALLING THESE TOGETHER YOU DON'T NEED TO INSTAL `bootstrap` PACKAGE)

LOOKS LIKE EASY WAY OF BUILDING UI, BOOTSWATCH BRINGS ALREADY  PICKED UP STYLE THEME

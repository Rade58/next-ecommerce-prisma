# SEARCH FOR PRODUCTS

WE WON'T BE DOING AUTOCOMPLETE

WHICH CAN IMPLEMENT THIS BY USING [THIS FROM MATERIAL UI](https://material-ui.com/components/autocomplete/#autocomplete), OR ON OUR OWN (IF YOU WANT TO TRY ON YOUR OWN, CHECK THIS OUT <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-react-autocomplete>)

**BUT FOR OUR PROJECT WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE SEARCH BOX AND WE WON'T HAVE LIST OF POSSIBLE RESULTS** (WE WILL SEARCH JUST BY ENTERING TEXT AND PRESSING ENTER)

## I DEVELOPED THIS FOR FRONTEND

```
cat components/Search.tsx
```

## AND THIS IS API ROUTE FOR GETTING ALL PRODUCT NAMES, AND FOR GETTING ALL SLUGS

```
cat pages/api/products/slugs.ts
```

WE ARE HITTING THIS ROUTE ONLY WHEN HEADER MOUNTS

I THINK RESOULT FROM THIS ROUTE NEEDS TO BE IN LOCAL STORAG OR SOMETHING (I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT RIGHT NOW)

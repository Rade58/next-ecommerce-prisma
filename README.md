# `/place-order` PAGE

WE ALREADY SKAFFOLD IT

## THIS PAGE WILL HAVE SUMMARY OF THINGS THAT USER HAS IN HIS CART, PAYMENT METHOD, SHIPPING INFO

WE BUILT AND HOOKED UP THIS

```
cat components/7_place_order_page/SummaryList.tsx
```

# WE FORGOT TO PUT LOGIC FOR TAX PRICE AND SHIPPING PRICE SO WE JUST PRESENTED SOME RANDOM VALUES AND SUMED THEM WITH TOTAL PRICE

I ALSO SET TOTAL PRICE AS A COOOKIE VALUE

AND WE WILL SET TOTAL PRICE AS A COOKIE TOO (JUST SO WE DON'T CACLCUALATE IT ALL THE TIME)

**BUT AT THE END TACX PRICE AND SHIPPING PRICE WILL END UP AS FIELDS IN ORDER RECORD**

## WE COULD MAKE BETTER UI AROUND ORDER, BUT THIS WILL DO THE JOB

## WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD ROUTE FOR CREATING ORDER RECORD

```
cat pages/api/order/[orderId].ts
```

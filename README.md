# CHECKOUT PROCESS, SETTING UP STUFF, SKAFFOLDING PAGES, MAKING REDIRECTS

WE WILL HAVE SHIPPING PAGE

```
touch pages/shipping.tsx
```

WE CREATED BUTTON ON OUR SHOPPING CART THAT NAVIGATES US TO SHIPPING PAGE (WHEN USER PRESSES TO `Go To Checkout` BUTTON)

**IF YOU ARE NOT SIGNIN AND YOU GO TO SHIPPING PAGE, YOU SHOULD BE REDIRETED TO SIGNIN PAGE**

WE ARE GOING TO SET THAT UP FIRST

**I HAD PROBLEMS MAKING REDIRECT SERVER SIDE, SO I DID IT FRONT END**

**BUT ALSO WHEN YOU LOG IN YOU SHOUD BE REDDIRECCTED T O SHIPPING**

SO WE NEED TO DEFINE THAT LOGIC

**WE CAN CHECK HISTORY AND DO SOME REDIRECTS BASED ON HISTORY**

**I THINK WE NEED TO USE ANOTHER MACHINE, THAT WILL HANDLE THAT REDIRECTING, OR BETTER TO SAY PROGRAMMATICAL NAVIGATION**

BEFORE MAKING MACHINE WE ALREADY DEFINED THAT NAVIGATION IF THERE IS NO SESSION ON /shipping PAGE

WE WILL START DDEFINING MACHINE THAT IS TIGHT

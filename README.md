# BUILDING "BETTER" PAGINATION FOR PRODUCTS

RATHER, LET'S USE TERM "DFIFFERENT" THAN "BETTER", BECAUSE WE WILL ONLY USE DIFFERENT TYPE OF PAGINATION

**WE WILL USE "SKIP BASED PGINATION" OR BETTER TO SAY [`"OFFSET BASED PGINATION"`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/pagination#offset-pagination)**

FIRST LET'S CHANGE OUR INDEX PAGE IN TERMS WHAT ARE WE QUERYING

INDEX PAGE SHOULD HAVE ONLY 10 MOST POPULAR PRODUCTS

AND IT SHOULD HAVE LINK FOR `SEE MORE PRODUCTS`

THAT SHOULD TAKE USER TO TO THE `/products/p/[pageNumber]` PAGE

```
mkdir pages/products/p && touch "pages/products/p/[pageNum].tsx"
```

AND FOR THIS PAGE WE WILL DEFINE LINKS FOR PAGINATION

AS YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF OUR DATBASE WE NEED TO PAY TTENTION TO CURSOR

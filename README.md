# WE DON'T WANT TO USE `/api/auth/signin` AS OUR SIGNIN PAGE, WE WANT CUSTOM PAGE

**ALSO WE WILL CREATE CUSTOM "verify email page"**(A PAGE WHERE USER IS REDDIRECTED AFTER SUBMITING EMAIL)

MAYBE LATER I'LL ADD CUSTOM ERROR PAGE

BUT FOR NOW, BEFORE WE MADE ACTUAL PAGE LETS SPECIFY OUR CUSTOM SIGNIN PAGE IN OUR NEXT-AUTH CONFIGURATION

```
code pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```

```ts

```

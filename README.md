# MAKING CORRECTIONS TO OUR SCHEMA

IN LAST BRNCH I FORGOT TO THINK OF SOME MODELS I CAN ADD

ALSO WE NEED TO ALTER TYPES ON SOME FIELDS

WE NEED THESE MODELS:

`Order` MODEL (**ONE ORDER CAN BE AN ORDER FOR MANY PRODUCTS (JUST THINK OF THAT)**)

`Review` MODEL

WE NEED `reviews` FIELD ON `Product`

AND WE NEED PRODUCR REFERENCE ON Review RECORD


# I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO USE `Trnsaction` MODEL (TABLE) AT ALL

I ALSO HAVE A MISTKE IN IT SINCE IT IS USED AS A TRNSACTION FOR ONLY ONE PRODUCT

AND THAT WONT BE THE CASE IN MY APP

# CHECKOUT PROCESS, SETTING UP STUFF, SKAFFOLDING PAGES, MAKING REDIRECTS

WE WILL HAVE SHIPPING PAGE

```
touch pages/shipping.tsx
```

WE CREATED BUTTON ON OUR SHOPPING CART THAT NAVIGATES US TO SHIPPING PAGE (WHEN USER PRESSES TO `Go To Checkout` BUTTON)

**IF YOU ARE NOT SIGNIN AND YOU GO TO SHIPPING PAGE, YOU SHOULD BE REDIRETED TO SIGNIN PAGE**

ALSO DEPENDING ON SESSION WE NAVIGATE TO SHIPPING OR TO SIGNING PAGE, WHEN USER PRESSES "GO TO CHECKOUT" BUTTON

WE ARE GOING TO SETUP SOME REDIRECTS (OR BETTER TO CALL THEM: PROGRMMATIC NAVIGATION)

**BUT ALSO WHEN YOU LOG IN YOU SHOUD BE REDDIRECCTED T O SHIPPING**

SO WE NEED TO DEFINE THAT LOGIC

# INSTEAD OF MACHINE WE WILL AGAIN USE COOKIE FOR THIS

WE WILL USE THIS LOGIC ON MAIN AND SIGNIN PAGE

IF UNAUTHORIZED USER ATTEMPTED TO GO TO SHIPPING WE WILL SET UP COOKIE THAT HE ATTEMPTED THAT

**ON SIGNIN PAGE, AND ON INDEX PAGE (JUST TO BE SURE), WE WILL CHECK FOR THAT COKKIE, IF COKKIE IS SETTED WE ARE GOING TO NAVIGATE TO SHIPPING**

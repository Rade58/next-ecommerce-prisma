# BUILDING ECOMMERCE APP WITH NEXTJS AND POSTGRES

BOOTSTRAPED WITH `npx create-next-app --typescript`

# TECHOLOGIES I'M WORKING WITH

- `next-connect`

- `supabase` (postgres datbbbase)

- `prisma` (ORM)

- `emotion` (css)

- `Material-Ui` (react components library)

- `next-auth`

- `xstate` AND `@xstate/react` (ONLY FOR SHOPPING CART)

- `PayPal`

# CSS IS ONLY GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH

NOT PLANNING TO INVEST TOO MUCH TIME INTO DESIGN

I AM USING MATERIAL UI (I AM PLANNING TO REWRITE THIS IN SOME OTHER COMMPONENT LIBRARY)

# ON THE OTHER HAND I AM GOING IN DEPTH ABOUT, HOOKING UP AND DEVELOPING CHECKOUT PROCESS

I WILL BE USING PAYPAL FOR THIS PURPOSE
